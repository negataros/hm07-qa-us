# Sprint 7 project
// Testing for these two GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests:
    Check the response status code.
    Parse the response and check that the response body contains the expected data.
//Tested using the Visual Studio Code program and Postman using swagger to find the required API endpoints and bodies where needed.
//To run each of the 4 tests, run [npx jest] with the name of one of the tests in the terminal (using the DELETE test for example: npx jest deleteHandlers.test.js)
